# Egg-Catching-Game

Eggs Catcher is a classic game where the goal is to catch as many eggs
as possible. In this game, every egg you catch will increase your score
and if you miss 3 eggs you will lose the game. In this project, I will walk
you through how to create an egg catcher game using Python.
An egg catcher game tests your concentration and the speed of your
reflexes as you have to catch eggs falling all around the screen with one
basket. To create an egg catcher game you have to design an animation
of falling eggs at random positions and a basket will be catching all the
falling eggs.
To create an eggs catcher game using Python, your first step will be to
design a floor, basket, and eggs. Once your game starts, the eggs will
gradually move across the floor, which will create an animation
indicating that the eggs are falling. Then with the help of loops, we can
constantly check that the eggs have been caught in the basket or have
touched the ground. When the egg is caught or dropped, it will be an end
of an event, so here the egg will be removed and the game has to adjust
the score by increasing the score if the egg was caught in the basket or
by decreasing your one life if the egg has touched the ground.
